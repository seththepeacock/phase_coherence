PlotRevisedNsoae4.py [2025.08.12ff]

Purpose: Using human SOAE peak freqs as determined via EXplotSOAEwfP13B.py
(see notes below on params), this code calculates various related quantities
(e.g. Nsoae) and also create a "Fig.4" panels for the coherence paper that shows how
Nsoae estimates can change for peak-picking from standard spectrally-avgd.
magnitudes versus xi-adjusted phase time-avgd. mags (as per EXplotSOAEwfP13B.py)
    
-------
NOTES

o [2025.08.13ff] For v.4, using a slightly modified that allowed me to plot the entire raw
wf and visually identify if/when there were large artifacts (e.g., a cough). In 
cases where things were localized to a segment of time, I made shorter waveforms
that excluded those regions so to have a more artifact-free waveform, even if
shorter. These have the suffix "short". I analyzed those in a similar fashion 
to see if there were any obvious changes in SOAE peaks (as described below). Overall,
this re-analysis had a subtle (though non-trivial) effect, nothing major though. 
In general, getting rid of artifacts seems to = good thing to do though.

o v.4 tweaks SOAE peak freq. vals to be a bit more conservative and 
verifiable via the "FIG.21" in EXplotSOAEwfP13B.py, as well as display
some basic stats back

o To create a string that can then be used to point towards a variable, 
use the eval command as follows:
    > # eval('name'+str(some#)+'anythingElse')
o Converting SOAE waveform files from .txt to .mat (i.e., from ascii to
 binary to reduce memory sans compression) is done via Matlab as follows:
    >  wf= load('filename.txt');  
    > save('filename','wf')

# 14 s. So will create a slightly shortened wf1 that is 106 s long (without
